# HSBCO
We proposed a hybrid surrogate-based constrained optimization method (HSBCO), and the main innovation is that a new constraint-handling method is proposed to map the feasible region into the origin of the Euclidean subspace. Thus, if the constraint violation of an infeasible solution is large, then it is far from the origin in the Euclidean subspace. Therefore, all constraints of the problem can be transformed into an equivalent equality constraint, and the distance between an infeasible point and the origin in the Euclidean subspace represents the constraint violation of the infeasible solution. Based on the distance, the objective function of the problem can be penalized by a Gaussian penalty function, and the original constrained optimization problem becomes an unconstrained optimization problem. Thus, the feasible solutions of the original minimization problem always have a lower objective function value than any infeasible solution in the penalized objective space.
